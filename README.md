> A collaborative, open-source guide for building a DIY Queen-Size Bed Frame.

## Overview

![App Preview](/public/preview.png)

**Woodframe Blueprint** is a modern, interactive web application that guides users through the process of building a sturdy, elegant wooden platform bed.

Built with **React** and **Vite**, this application transforms static instructions into a dynamic, reliable, and beautiful digital blueprint.

## Features
- **Interactive Guide:** Step-by-step instructions broken down into manageable phases.
- **Tools & Materials:** Clear lists with specific dimensional cut requirements.



- **Safety First:** Dedicated sections for personal protective equipment and safe workspace setup.
- **Premium UI:** A "Glassmorphism" aesthetic that feels refined and pleasant to use.
- **Responsive:** Works great on tablets and phones for use in the workshop.


## Project Structure
This project is data-driven, separating the guide content from the UI components.

- `src/data/projectData.js`: **The Schema**. All project measurements, steps, and lists are defined here.
- `src/components/`: Reusable UI elements (`Navigation`, etc.).
- `src/pages/`: The core views of the application.


## Technologies
- **Vite**: Next Generation Frontend Tooling
- **React**: Library for web user interfaces
